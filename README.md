#  HIV Inhibitor Classification with Graph Transformer

.  Developed a graph neural network model to classify HIV inhibitors with 99% accuracy and 0.6 precision, outperforming initial GATConv results (Recall: 0.43, Accuracy: 96%, ROC AUC: 0.86/0.74).

.  Leveraged edge attributes with Graph Transformer layers to achieve state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the importance of incorporating edge information in molecular property prediction tasks.
