# -inhibit-HIV-replication
This project explores the development of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model which Experimentally measured abilities to inhibit HIV replication, where I initially utilized GATConv layers but encountered suboptimal results, leading me to pivot and implement Graph TransformerConv layers to achieve improved performance and accuracy
